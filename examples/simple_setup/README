This example directory will create a dust density distribution and a temperature distribution and also the opacity based on dsharp_opac. 

Start with problem_setup.py which will create the spatial grid and structures
Use plot_structure.py to look at the 2D distribution of temperature and density

Then use problem_opacity.py to obtain the opacity information. You will need to have downloaded dsharp_opac
Use plot_opacity.py to look at the opacity values

To create images, use plot_image.py which will call radmc3d to calculate image and then read the image and produce a plot
